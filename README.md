# Overview
This program is a C++ implementation of a class called Sphere. The class models a sphere with a set radius (size) and center coordinate (xPos, yPos). The class has a number of methods that allow the user to perform various actions on the sphere such as moving it, setting its size, calculating its area, displaying it and checking if it intersects with another sphere. The class also has a class invariant that ensures the radius (size) of the sphere is always positive.

The program also includes a test driver called SphereTestDriver1.cpp and SphereTestDriver2.cpp which creates multiple spheres and tests the methods of the Sphere class to ensure they are working as expected.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you will need a machine running 64-bit Linux Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. You will also need a C++ compiler installed on the machine.

# Files
